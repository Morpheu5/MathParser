# MathParser

A parser of math formulas to allow text entry on https://isaacphysics.org/equality

This is no more than a demo application. This code will eventually make its way into Isaac Physics.

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

Some of the expressions that this can parse right now are

- `x + y`
- `t_0`
- `alpha_t0`
- `sin(x)`
- `sin(x)^2`
- `e^(i*omega + phi)`

Other features:

- [x] Greek letters to be converted to their Unicode counterparts
- [ ] radicals
- [ ] (in)equalities
- [ ] differentials and derivatives
- [ ] absolute values, maybe?
